I am a scientist and artist working across Earth observation and environmental data science. I investigate how the natural and built environment changes across time and space and try to make work that connects with a diverse range of people. My artistic practice is heavily entwined with the research process and driven by data, networks and sound, taking shape through audiovisual works and performances. Some of the tools I use in my work include spatio-temporal analysis, earth observation, data sonification, acoustic ecology and machine learning along with field based validation.

If you wish to collaborate on something or have any questions feel free to reach out.
