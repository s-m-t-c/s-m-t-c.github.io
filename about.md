I am a scientist and artist based in Canberra, Australia / Ngunnawal Country

My work applies a geospatial lens to the natural environment, built environment and identity with an aim of deconstructing boundaries between science and art.

My artistic practice is heavily entwined with the research process and driven by data, networks and sound, taking shape through audiovisual works and performances. 

Some of the tools I use in my work include spatio-temporal analysis, earth observation, data sonification, acoustic ecology and machine learning along with field based validation.
