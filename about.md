I am a scientist and artist based in Hobart / Nipaluna.

My work applies a geospatial lens to the natural environment, built environment and identity.

My artistic practice is heavily entwined with the research process and driven by data, networks and sound, taking shape through audiovisual works and performances. 

Some of the tools I use in my work include spatio-temporal analysis, earth observation, data sonification, acoustic ecology and machine learning along with field based validation.

If you wish to collaborate on something or have any questions feel free to reach out.
