    <!-- About me Section -->
    <section id="about">
      <p>I am a multidisciplinary scientist and artist working across remote sensing and data science with a focus on Earth systems, polar regions, and sound. Currently, I work as a researcher at the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Norway, as well as being an independent consultant and an artist. Previously I was an assistant director in the Australian Antarctic Division Sea Ice team.</p>      
      <p>Some of my interests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High-resolution sea ice drift tracking using synthetic aperture radar</li>
        <li>Acoustic signaling and behavior of Weddell seals (I think I heard the world's best kickdrum when I dropped a hydrophone into the sea ice at McMurdo Sound)</li>
        <li>Bridging the dark space between modelers and observationalists</li>
        <li>The "user experience" of interacting with spatial information</li>
        <li>Hybrid music composition techniques drawing from graphic scores, sonification and ~vibe</li>
        <li>Multi-sensor data integration, combining laser altimetry and microwave radiometry, expanding those beautiful detailed pulses to larger areas</li>
      </ul>
